# SimpleArduinoGame

My first coding project

It is basically clone of game called simon says. With an exception that there is only two lights instead of four.

There are two led light and random one of them lights up. Then you have to remember which light it was and press on of the two buttons. If you press right button then it flashes the same led that it previously plus does second random flashing. If again you get correct answer then it does same with third flashing also and so on. If you press wrong button game starts from beginning lighting only one random led again.
